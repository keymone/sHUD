sHUD is very simple and pixelperfect addon that replaces IceHUD for me which became resource and performance hog recently

not configurable, 10kb memory usage, 2 health bars and 2 power bars. what else would you need?

addon rescales your interface to be pixelperfect. if you dont want perfectness - disable it in line 10 of sHUD.lua

you can also change other options in there:

* height, width - do i really have to explain that?
* distance - from center of screen to the point where closest bars are shown
* spacing - between bars
* padding - width of black border
